  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Sanatana Dharma ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Shloka mobile application (the "App" or "Service").

  <h2>2. Information We Process</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Spiritual Content and App Preferences</h3>
  <p>
    The App downloads spiritual content (such as shlokas, chapters, and related data) and stores content and settings locally on your device for app functionality.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Subscription and Entitlement Data (RevenueCat + App Stores)</h3>
  <p>
    If you use paid features, we process limited subscription-related data through app stores and RevenueCat to validate purchases and manage access.

  <ul>
    <li>Pseudonymous app user ID (for example, values like <code>usr_...</code>)</li>
    <li>Subscription product ID and entitlement status (active/expired/etc.)</li>
    <li>Purchase lifecycle event data (renewal, cancellation, expiration, refund/revoke)</li>
    <li>Store/environment metadata (for example, App Store / Sandbox / Production)</li>
    <li>Technical request metadata needed for security, reliability, and abuse prevention</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
